# My Advanced Blog

## Description
This project is a simple blog website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a responsive design powered by **Bootstrap**. The site includes blog articles, a sidebar, and a "Back to Top" button. The layout is styled with custom CSS and transitions.

### File Overview

1. **index.html**:
   - The main webpage structure that includes a navigation bar, a section with blog articles, a sidebar for additional information, and a footer with a contact form. This file also links to Bootstrap and Font Awesome for quick styling and icons.

2. **style.css**:
   - Contains custom styles for the website. Variables are used for colors and spacing to make styling easier. CSS transitions are applied for smooth hover effects and animations, such as the "Back to Top" button appearing as you scroll.

3. **main.js**:
   - Handles interactivity, such as the "Back to Top" button. When the user scrolls down 100px from the top, the button becomes visible, and clicking it smoothly scrolls the page back to the top.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap for mobile responsiveness.
- **Smooth Scroll to Top**: A button appears when scrolling down, which when clicked, smoothly scrolls back to the top of the page.
- **CSS Transitions**: Cards and buttons have hover effects and smooth transitions for a polished UI experience.
- **Custom Styling**: Defined using CSS variables (`:root`) for easy customization of colors, shadows, and spacing.
- **Contact Form**: Includes a simple contact form for users to submit their details.
